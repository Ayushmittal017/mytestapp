My Test App
This is a very basic app which took around 7 hours of effort to develop. This might lack in design but makes up for that in the functionality.
Basics installation steps are as for every app go inside the “mytestapp” folder and run the “npm i” command.
After you have installed the npm dependencies you need to run the app.
To Start the app, go to “mytestapp” folder and then run these following commands in separate terminals:
1.	npm run start
2.	npm run server
the “start” command will execute the angular app and the “server” command will run the json server(port:3000). You will need to run these command parallelly in two terminals. 
Once done navigate to localhost:4200/ in the browser to run the app.
